Dana is just playing with Tumbler concepts here.


Basic Concept for a Solidity Tumbler
Deposit Phase: Users send ETH to the contract, specifying a destination address where they want their ETH sent later.

Mixing Mechanism: The contract pools the funds and waits for enough participants or a time delay to obscure transaction tracing.

Withdrawal Phase: The contract sends ETH to the specified destination addresses in a way that breaks the direct link between the original sender and the recipient.

Key Points and Limitations
Anonymity: This basic version doesn’t fully anonymize transactions. Blockchain analysis can still link deposits and withdrawals unless you add complexity like random delays, fixed deposit amounts, or integration with privacy tools (e.g., zk-SNARKs).

Security: Smart contracts are vulnerable to bugs or exploits (e.g., re-entrancy attacks). A real tumbler would need rigorous auditing.

Legality: In many jurisdictions, operating or using a mixer could attract regulatory scrutiny, especially if tied to illicit activity. Research local laws before building or deploying this.

Improvements: For better privacy, you could integrate with existing solutions like Tornado Cash (before its sanctions) or use zero-knowledge proofs, though that increases complexity.

Existing Solutions
Rather than building from scratch, you could study open-source mixers like Tornado Cash (pre-sanctions code is still on GitHub) or explore privacy-focused chains like Monero or Zcash, which offer built-in anonymity. If you’re set on Ethereum, look into zk-rollups or Layer 2 solutions with privacy features.
